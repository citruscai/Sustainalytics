        At ConocoPhillips, our core mission is to meet energy demand sustainably while generating enduring value for our employees, communities, and shareholders. We are dedicated to playing a pivotal role in the energy transition, aligning with the objectives of our Triple Mandate: meeting demand within transition pathways, delivering competitive returns on and of capital, and striving for net-zero operational emissions. Sustainability is deeply embedded in our company ethos, guiding our foundational principles. Over decades, we have integrated sustainability into our planning and decision-making processes, establishing frameworks to identify and manage environmental and social concerns long before publishing our inaugural Sustainable Development (SD) report in 2005. Our approach has evolved to adapt to shifting trends in science, demographics, technology, and policy, ensuring alignment with emerging risks and opportunities. Since our early stances on SD and climate change in 2003, we have refined our positions, extending them to encompass water management, biodiversity preservation, human rights, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Continuously enhancing our governance structure, we manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout our organization, underpinned by a commitment to ongoing improvement and internal validation within our systems-based approach.
